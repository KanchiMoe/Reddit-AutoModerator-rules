  Hi /u/{{author}}, thanks for your {{kind}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > ### Link to image hosting website.

  > /r/{{subreddit}} requires that all submissions are able to verify that the person is genuinely missing. This is usually done via news websites, police/law enforcement websites or recognised charity websites.

  > The site your {{kind}} links to, {{domain}}, allows users to upload/submit any image without having to verify that the person is genuinely missing.

  > **If you have a news article, or a press release from the police/law enforcement, please use that instead.**

  > You can post a link to images in the comments.
