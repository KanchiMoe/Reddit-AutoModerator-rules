message: |
  Hi /u/{{author}}, thanks for [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) to /r/{{subreddit}}. Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > ### Link to crowdfunding website.

  > Crowdfunding websites do not verify if the person listed is genuinely missing or not.

  > As such, we (the /r/{{subreddit}} moderators) can not verify if:

  > * the person listed is genuinely missing or not

  > * who, or where, any money raised goes to, or that it will be spent on this missing person.

  > And as such, are not allowed on /r/{{subreddit}}.

  > Furthermore, we feel that /r/{{subreddit}} is not an appropriate subreddit to be canvassing for money, even if it is genuine. The risk for scams is just too high. You may want to try in a subreddit for your local area or country instead.
