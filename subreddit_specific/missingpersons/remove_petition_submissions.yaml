  Hi /u/{{author}}, thanks for your {{kind}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Sadly, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > **Link to petition site.**

  > /r/{{subreddit}} requires that all submissions are able to verify that the person is genuinely missing, and only allows links to police, news or recognised charities websites.

  > Petition websites do not verify if the person listed is genuinely missing, and as such, are not allowed.

  > Furthermore, We don't feel that /r/{{subreddit}} is not an appropriate subreddit for petition canvassing. You may want to try in a subreddit for your local area or country instead.
