  Hi /u/{{author}}, thanks for your {{kind}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > ### Link to crowdfunding website.

  > /r/{{subreddit}} requires that all submissions are able to verify that the person is genuinely missing, and only allows links to police, news or recognised charities websites.

  > Crowdfunding websites do not verify if the person listed is genuinely missing, and as such, are not allowed.

  > **If you have a news article, or a press release from the police/law enforcement, please use that instead.**

  > Furthermore, we feel that /r/{{subreddit}} is not an appropriate subreddit to be canvassing for money, even if it is genuine. The risk for scams is just too high. You may want to try in a subreddit for your local area or country instead.
