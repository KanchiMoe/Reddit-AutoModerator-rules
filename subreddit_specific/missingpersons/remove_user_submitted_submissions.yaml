  Hi /u/{{author}}, thanks for your {{kind}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Sadly, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > ### Link to user-hosted content site

  > /r/{{subreddit}} requires that all submissions are able to verify that the person is genuinely missing. This is usually done via news websites, police/law enforcement websites or recognised charity websites.

  > The site your {{kind}} links to, {{domain}}, allows users to upload/submit any type of content without verifying that the person is genuinely missing.

  > **If you have a news article, or a press release from the police/law enforcement, please use that instead.**
