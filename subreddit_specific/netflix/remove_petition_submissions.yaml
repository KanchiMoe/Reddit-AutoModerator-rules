  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but your {{kind}} has been removed for the follow reason(s):

  > ### Petitioning Netflix

  > This subreddit, /r/Netflix, is not owned or moderated by Netflix or any of their employees.

  > You should get in touch with [Netflix's customer service team](https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus) to make sure that your dissatisfaction is correctly logged with them. This is the best way to get them addressed, because they will not be seen by anyone that is in a position to do anything here, or via a petition site. The team [does (apparently) pay attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/3pudfh/_/cwcxs2b/) to these complaints.

  > Customer services: https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus
