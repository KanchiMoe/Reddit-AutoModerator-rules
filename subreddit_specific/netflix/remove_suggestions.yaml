  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but your {{kind}} has been removed for the follow reason(s):

  > ### Suggestion/Question for Netflix

  > This subreddit, /r/Netflix, is not owned or moderated by Netflix or any of their employees.

  > Suggestions/Questions should be directed to [Netflix's customer service team](https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus) on the link below. This is the best way to get them addressed, because they will not be seen by anyone that is in a position to do anything here.
