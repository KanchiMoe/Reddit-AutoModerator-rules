  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### New UI post

  > You should use this megathread to comment and discuss

  > **[/r/netflix/comments/1mcqw77/megathread_the_new_ui_update/](https://redd.it/1mcqw77)**

  > Additionally, If you haven't already, you really should send any feedback about the UI directly to Netflix directly [via their customer service team](https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus) on the link below. The team [does (apparently) pay attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/3pudfh/_/cwcxs2b/).

  > * https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus

  > This subreddit, /r/Netflix, is not owned or moderated by Netflix or any of their employees, so comments on the UI will not be seen by anyone in a position to do anything here.
