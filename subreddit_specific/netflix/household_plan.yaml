  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Household plan complaint

  > We get it. No one likes this. [We've been getting the same posts about it for months](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/search?q=household&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all). 

  > If you haven't already you **_really should_** send feedback about this directly to Netflix [via their customer service team](https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus) on the link below. They, aparently, [pay attention with an internal tracker for customer complaints](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/3pudfh/_/cwcxs2b/).

  > This subreddit is not owned or moderated by Netflix or any of their employees, so comments about the household plan will not be seen by anyone in a position to do anything here.
