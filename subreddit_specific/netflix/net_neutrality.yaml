  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Politics - Net Neutrality

  > Your {{kind}} appears to be discussing net neutrality.

  > Unless there is a _very direct_ connection to Netflix, r/Netflix is not the right place for this topic. If there is, message the moderators on the link below.

  Was this incorrect?
