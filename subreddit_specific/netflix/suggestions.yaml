  Hi /u/{{author}}. Thanks for your post to /r/{{subreddit}}. Sadly, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

  > **Suggestion for Netflix.** - [rule 9](/r/{{subreddit}}/about/rules).

  > Suggestions for Netflix should be directed to [Netflix's customer services team](https://help.netflix.com/en/contactus). Sending them there is the best way to get them addressed.

  > The same suggestions get submitted on a weekly basis, among other reasons. Please _do not_ resubmit the post with a different title. It will be removed and your account may be banned.
