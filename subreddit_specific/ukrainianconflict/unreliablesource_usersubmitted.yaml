  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### User submitted content website

  > /r/{{subreddit}} hopes to foster informed and intelligent discussion of the facts.

  > The website your {{kind}} links to, {{domain}}, allows anyone to make an account; and allows users to upload or submit any type of content without the need to verify that what they are publishing is the truth.

  > As a result, it has been identified as an unreliable source, and is not permitted on /r/{{subreddit}}

  Was this incorrect?
