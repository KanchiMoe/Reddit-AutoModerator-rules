  Hi /u/{{author}}, this is a courtesy message about the {{kind}} you made on /r/{{subreddit}}.

  *****

  Your {{kind}} included the phrase "{{match}}".

  We, as the /r/{{subreddit}} community moderators, recognise that this is a well known, often quoted, memed, phrase from the Frieren anime.

  The reddit administrators (employees of reddit) and it's AI content removal system however, do not know that. We have tried to explain this to them several times.

  We have approved your {{kind}}. However Your {{kind}} might get removed in the future by the reddit administrators (or it's AI systems) for "inciting violence". You may get warned too.

  Again, we (as the moderators) know that this isn't the case, and do not agree with this removal. We have tried to get the reddit admins to stop, but they have not done so.

  If your {{kind}} does get removed - **we strongly urge you to appeal it's removal** on these grounds.
