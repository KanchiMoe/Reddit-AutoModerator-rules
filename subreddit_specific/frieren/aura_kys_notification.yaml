  Hi /u/{{author}}, this is a courtesy message about the {{kind}} you made on /r/{{subreddit}}.

  *****

  Your {{kind}} included the phrase "{{match}}".

  We, as the community moderators, recognise that this is a well known, often quoted, phrase from the Frieren anime.

  The reddit administrators, and it's content removal system however, do not know that. Even though we have explained it to them several times.

  Your {{kind}} might get removed in the future by the reddit administrators (or it's AI systems) for "inciting violence".

  Again, we (as the moderators) know that it isn't. We have tried to get the reddit admins to stop doing this, but they have not done so.

  If your {{kind}} does get removed - **we strongly urge you to appeal it's removal** on these grounds.
