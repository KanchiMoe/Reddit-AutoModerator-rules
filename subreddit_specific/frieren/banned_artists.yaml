  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but your [{{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Artist known for explicit content

  > The artist, {{match}}, consistently creates material that goes beyond what's acceptable under /r/{{subreddit}}'s NSFW rule.

  > While /r/{{subreddit}} does allow some mildly suggestive or risqué artwork, this artist's work is typically overtly explicit or inappropriate and therefore not permitted here.

  If this artwork _is not_ explicit or inappropriate, use the link below.
