  Hi /u/{{author}}, your {{kind}} is currently under review for the following reason(s):

  > ### Artist known for suggestive content

  > The artist, {{match}}, often creates content that can go beyond what is acceptable under /r/{{subreddit}}'s NSFW rule.

  > While /r/{{subreddit}} does allow some mildly suggestive or risqué artwork, content that's overtly explicit or inappropriate isn't permitted.

  > Because this artist's work varies, we're manually reviewing your {{kind}} to ensure it fits within the subreddit's guidelines.

  **Please don't delete your {{kind}}**. It will be reviewed by a moderator as soon as possible.
