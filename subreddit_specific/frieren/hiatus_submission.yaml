  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but your [{{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Hiatus spoiler/leak

  > We do not allow {{kind}}s about a hiatus (either starting or ending) before it has been officially announced.

  > Assume that it isn't true unless it has been officially announced. If it has been announced, there will be a post about it on the subreddit.

  > Please wait for it to be officially announced before making any {{kind}}s on it.

  _Thanks for your understanding._

  Was this a mistake? Has it been officially announced or unrelated?
