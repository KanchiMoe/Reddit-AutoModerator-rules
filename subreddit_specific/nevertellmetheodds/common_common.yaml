  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Not odds defying / common occurrence

  > Submissions must be nearly impossible feats of achievement, those with great degree of difficulty or incredible odds.

  > Your {{kind}} seems to be about a very common occurrence.

  Thank you for contributing to the subreddit!
