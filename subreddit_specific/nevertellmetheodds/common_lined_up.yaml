  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Not odds defying

  > Submissions must be nearly impossible feats of achievement, those with great degree of difficulty or incredible odds.

  > Posts lining up, or being next to each other are not odds-defying.
