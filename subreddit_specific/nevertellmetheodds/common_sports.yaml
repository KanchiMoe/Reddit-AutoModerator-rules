  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but [your {{kind}}]({{permalink}}) was removed from /r/{{subreddit}} for the following reason(s):

  > ### Not odds defying

  > Submissions must be nearly impossible feats of achievement, those with great degree of difficulty or incredible odds.

  > Posts based entirely around skill and/or persistence, including deliberate tricks and stunts, are not allowed.

  > Sports fall in this category.

  Thank you for contributing to the subreddit!
