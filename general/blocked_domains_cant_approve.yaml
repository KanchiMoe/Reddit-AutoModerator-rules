  Sorry /u/{{author}}, but Reddit is currently automatically removing any {{kind}} that contain links to `{{match-2}}`.

  **We can not restore your {{kind}}**. This restriction has been placed by Reddit itself. There is nothing we (as moderators) can do about bypassing or restoring it. Please **do not** message us asking us to restore it, because we can't.

  We can't restore your {{kind}} even if you remove the link. You will need to resubmit it entirely with the links removed.
