message: |

    We have automatically set the "Found deceased" flair on your post: **[{{title}}]({{permalink}})**. This was done because ``{{match}}`` was detected in the title.

    If this was set incorrectly, please [contact the moderation team here](/message/compose?to=/r/{{subreddit}}&subject=Flair set incorrectly&message={{permalink}}).
